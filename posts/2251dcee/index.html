                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <h2 id="abstract"><a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract">🌊</a>Abstract</h2>
                <p>This paper contains some improvements on an algorithmic melody composer called “T-music”. “T-music” is an algorithm which can compose a melody for users’ input lyrics by mining the relationship between the melodies and lyrics. These relationships
                  are known as frequent patterns (FPS) . The ameliorations are two ways to enhance the methods of mining frequent patterns form instrumental compositions and an optimal way of using FPS mined from songs in one language to compose a melody
                  for the input things in another language.</p>
                <h2 id="propse"><a class="header-anchor" href="#propse">🌊</a>Propse</h2>
                <p>The propose is to get an algorithm which take lyrics as input and a good melody as outcome in order to help those people who have little music background to compose songs. In view of the fact that there is already a pretty well method,
                  T-music, the authors’ tasks are making some improvements on the basis of the original algorithm.</p>
                <h2 id="deficiencies-of-original-algorithm"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deficiencies-of-original-algorithm">🌊</a>Deficiencies of original algorithm</h2>
                <p>At the first place, I need to borrow a figure from the paper as follows to express my understanding of the original T-music method.</p>
                <p><img src="http://www.meng.uno/images/t-music-arch.png" alt="t-musuc"></p>
                <p>As the picture shows that the system architecture of T-music can be divided as two phases which are “Frequent Pattern Mining” and “Melody Composition”. I will report this method following the flow of the algorithm.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Mining the FPS from “Song Database” and storing them in the “Frequent Pattern Database”:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Obtaining tone sequences from “Song Database” by reading the “Language Dictionary”;</li>
                      <li>Generating s-sequence from a melody, a pitch sequence and a duration sequence;</li>
                      <li>Mining the FPS from s-sequence;</li>
                      <li>Storing the FPS to “Frequent Pattern Database”.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Composing a melody for the “Lyrics” based on FPS in the “Frequent Pattern Database”:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Obtaining the tone sequence of the lyrics by reading the “Language Dictionary”;</li>
                      <li>Adding some “Music Parameters” such as some music rules;</li>
                      <li>Generating “Melody” by the process “Melody Composition” using FPS.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are some deficiencies of the original T-music algorithm as follows. It can only mine FPS from songs in which lyrics must be present. What’s more, the original one can’t use the FPS mined from a language to compose melody in another
                  language. However, we can’t always get the ideal songs data which have lyrics embedded easily. What we can get from the Internet are those instrumental compositions in which lyrics are absent. Also, we want to achieve that composing
                  melody in a language with the FPS mined from another language which can make the algorithm more efficient.</p>
                <h2 id="improvements"><a class="header-anchor" href="#improvements">🌊</a>Improvements</h2>
                <p>What the authors have done provided two ways to mine Frequent Patterns from instrumental compositions and an optimal mapping method for composing a melody using FPS in different language with the input lyrics.</p>
                <p>The first way is “Method emphasizing the original FPS”. I will use the following picture to express my comprehension. Firstly, mining the FPS from songs and storing them in “FP database (General)”. Secondly, mining the frequent pitch trends
                  from “Instrumental compositions with style database” and storing them in “Frequent pitch trends (Style)” and then using it as a selector to select those FPS storing the matches in “FP database (Style)”.</p>
                <p><img src="http://www.meng.uno/images/t-music-database.png" alt="t-musuc"></p>
                <p>The second way is “Method emphasizing the newly mined frequent pitch trends”. I will also introduce it using the screenshot from the paper. The FPS based on those of the first way was subdivided. The frequent pitch trends are mined as
                  usually. The most difference is that one pitch trend may match a set of several tone trends.</p>
                <p><img src="http://www.meng.uno/images/t-music-database2.png" alt="t-musuc"></p>
                <p>The optimal mapping method is shown as follows. Firstly, using the same method gets a “FP database” in one language. Then, generating several tone sequences for each tone trend in this “FP database”. There are some lemmas proofed on the
                  paper to decide the specific number of the mapping.</p>
                <h1>Improvements</h1>
                <p>In this section, I will analysis some excellent algorithms, important thoughts or some key points. Some of them may look small or nothing special, but each has its function.</p>
                <h2 id="using-the-trend-representation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-trend-representation">🌊</a>Using the “Trend” representation</h2>
                <p>If I were doing this job, I could have chosen the simple “absolute” representation, just because this is the most intuitive frequent pattern we can get from songs. After careful consideration, just as the author explains that same melodies
                  which start at different pitches may sound similar to us. Then, I understand that it is a big wisdom to use the “trend” representation which uses a FP to extract the general rules of a set of FPS with different pitches, simplifying a
                  large number of calculations and making the result more obvious.</p>
                <h2 id="using-frequent-pitch-trends-style-as-a-selector"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-frequent-pitch-trends-style-as-a-selector">🌊</a>Using “Frequent pitch trends (Style)” as a selector</h2>
                <p>Though we know that “T-music” uses “the FPS between the tone port and the pitch part” and agree the mining method used on mining the frequent pattern which contains a tone trend and a pitch trend, there must be some correlation between
                  “Tone trend” and “Pitch trend”. Since the instrumental compositions don’t contain lyrics, we couldn’t mine a whole frequent pattern from them. However, we can also mine part of the frequent pattern from them which is “Pitch trend”. For
                  we have so much instrumental compositions which means we can get enough “Pitch trend” and we already know the correlation between “Tone trend” and “Pitch trend”, we can estimate the frequency of the original frequent pattern and eliminate
                  part of them which have a zero frequency.</p>
                <h2 id="using-the-subsequences-of-original-frequent-pattern"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-subsequences-of-original-frequent-pattern">🌊</a>Using the subsequences of original frequent pattern</h2>
                <p>According to the Apriori property that all nonempty subsets of frequent item set must also be frequent, the authors artfully break the original FPS into smaller form and then making them combine more FPS which can be selected from the
                  original FP database. By doing this, we can get more frequent patterns from the identical data which means our mining algorithm is more efficient.</p>
                <h2 id="using-multi-map-as-a-data-structure"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-multi-map-as-a-data-structure">🌊</a>Using multi-map as a data structure</h2>
                <p>This data structure allows the task of retrieving a value by a key quickly and returns more than one frequent pattern with a support. From it, we can get a tuple in top-k tuples with some selection strategies and ensure that a pattern
                  with a very large support isn’t always selected because it doesn’t mean that it is always the best choice.</p>
                <h2 id="employing-the-divide-and-conquer-idea"><a class="header-anchor" href="#employing-the-divide-and-conquer-idea">🌊</a>Employing the divide and conquer idea</h2>
                <p>Considering to compose a melody of a very long lyric, we may need to divide the original tone trend into several shorter tone trends, apply the same procedure on them and then return the concatenation of the results of the sub-problems.
                  It is a simple idea of solving such problem, but we can’t resist its correctness and effectiveness.</p>
                <h1>Limitations</h1>
                <p>I just list some areas that I think need improvements or I think it can be added slightly on the basis of the original research.</p>
                <h2 id="applying-word-segmentation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#applying-word-segmentation">🌊</a>Applying word segmentation</h2>
                <p>Though the paper has mentioned the use of word segmentation, there is just a word and no detailed explanation. I think I should express my own idea here. Firstly, the word segmentation here isn’t the same of those applied in the fields
                  of natural language processing (NLP). As we all known, the latter has so many strict norms to follow, however, in the lyrics, the norms aren’t very same. Why we do this in the input lyrics is because we want to determine the length of
                  durations between every two words, which is different from the propose in the NLP which just wants to add pause at the same length of time between words and words.</p>

                <p>In this paper, the authors just simply set the pitch trend to be the input tone trend where, I think, may need improvement. Firstly, we all know that “the tone trend with a length of 1” couldn’t appear individually. It is usually because
                  we matched the tone sequences before it or after it. I think if we consider dividing the original sequence into overlapping parts using the similar idea of divide and conquer idea, the question may disappear.</p>

                <p>The authors just determine the relationship based on statistics in whether the original T-music method or the improved edition, store the regulars on a multi-map and when using the frequent pattern, the method just randomly selects a tuple
                  from top-k tuples from the multi-map. Therefore, no matter which one we choose, it is just the original sequence in the FP-database. If there is a very large database which contains a large number of every frequent pattern, it may have
                  a remarkable effect without complex computations. However, we can’t ensure it or we just want to improve our algorithm with little support of so many records. Let’s look at the following samples which has the form as same as those in
                  the multi-map and assume that the same tone trend only has the three tuples.</p>

                <p>As we can see, they have the same tone trend and different pitch trends with different values of a support. If we just use the method described in the paper, we may get the result of the 1st, the 2nd, or the 3rd. However, is it the best
                  one? Maybe not, I think. I mean maybe <code>&lt;1,1,2,0,-2,-1&gt;</code> is better. I think we need to add some correlation analyses to the pitch trends which have the same tone trends.</p>
                <h1>Expanding Research</h1>
                <p>After reading this paper, I have some ideas for further research and some of them are listed as follows.</p>
                <h2 id="adding-location-variables"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-location-variables">🌊</a>Adding location variables</h2>
                <p>I mean, as we all known, a same lyric may have different melodies when it is at the beginning or at the end of a song. Of course, if we just want to use a simple sentence as its input, this consideration is rather superfluous. However,
                  if the input lyric is long enough, it is very important then.</p>
                <h2 id="generating-a-melody-with-a-longer-note"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-a-melody-with-a-longer-note">🌊</a>Generating a melody with a longer note</h2>
                <p>This thought is mentioned in the end of the paper as well. We may have noticed that the normal notes will be longer than the syllables of lyrics, at least at the end of each sentence. We may need to modify the match method to add the frequent
                  pattern which contains group of pitch trends sequences and its corresponding longer tone trends sequences.</p>
                <h2 id="applying-syntactic-analysis"><a class="header-anchor" href="#applying-syntactic-analysis">🌊</a>Applying syntactic analysis</h2>
                <p>The following is my exploratory opinion of the original T-music. If I have many songs with lyrics, I will mine the frequent patterns of syntactic analysis and add them to the “s-sequence” mentioned in this paper. Thus I will reform the
                  original multi-map as follows.</p>
                <figure class="highlight stylus">
                  <table>
                    <tr>
                      <td class="gutter">
                        <pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre>
                      </td>
                      <td class="code">
                        <pre><span class="line">(&lt;pitch trend pattern&gt;, &lt;syntax pattern&gt;) —&gt; (&lt;tone trend pattern&gt;, support)</span><br></pre>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                </figure>
                <p>When we match the input lyrics, we need to not only match the “pitch trend pattern” from the FP-database but also contrast the “syntax pattern” and then make the best decision.</p>
                <h2 id="expanding-to-speech-recognization"><a class="header-anchor" href="#expanding-to-speech-recognization">🌊</a>Expanding to speech recognization</h2>
                <p>I have a simple idea of speech recognization using the same method mentioned in this paper. If I could collect enough voice information spoken by the same person, I would mine the frequent patterns of his intonation habit from the voice
                  data and then using them to judge whether another voice is his or not.</p>
                <h2 id="expanding-to-password-security"><a class="header-anchor" href="#expanding-to-password-security">🌊</a>Expanding to password security</h2>
                <p>In order to prevent the password being stolen, all websites are making efforts on password diversity. I think the method of mining frequent pattern can be applied to protect users’ password as well. For the same string of ciphers, different
                  people may type it out in different speeds with different intermission on every two letters. I, for example, usually use the combination of my name and birthday as a password and when I type it out there is a longer break between the
                  last letter of my name and the first number of my birthday. If we use the same way to mine the frequent patterns form enough times records of someone, we may use the frequent patterns to judge whether it is the right person or not who
                  is typing the password.</p>
                <h2 id="generating-good-problems"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-good-problems">🌊</a>Generating “good problems”</h2>
                <p>I often encounter some tricky programming problems and as we all known, “StackOverflow” is the biggest website which can offer you relevant solutions when you ask a question on it. However, we all want to get the best answer as soon as
                  possible so we may need to put forward “good questions”. I think the thought of this paper can be applied to this question. We can first collect enough “good questions” from the website and then mine the syntactic frequent patterns of
                  each question by categories. Finally, we can generate such “good questions” by adding the knowledge of sentence construction and providing some keywords needed.</p>
                <h1>Related Research</h1>
                <p>This paper is about mining frequent patterns which is a subfield of data mining. I will express my understanding mixing information retrieved from the Internet in this field.</p>
                <p>With the rise of big data, so many research topics about data is more and more frequent such as forecasting passenger flow and passenger flow directions during the Spring Festival and predicting the composition of Chinese college entrance
                  examination this year. Data mining means the process of extracting valuable information and patterns from large amounts of data and these new discovery rules, patterns, information and concepts have potential value. It usually contains
                  the association rules, classification, estimation, clustering and so on.</p>
                <p>As for association analysis, its propose is to discover interesting links hidden in large data sets and the patterns discovered are usually represented in association rules or frequent item sets just as this paper shown. There are several
                  efficient and scalable frequent item set mining methods such as Apriori algorithm and FP-growth which needs to construct FP-tree.</p>
                <p>As for classification and prediction, I think it is a more stirring area. Think of this, a marketing manager needs data analysis to help guess whether or not a customer with a given profile will buy a new computer and then the marketing
                  manager would like to predict how much a given customer will spend during a sale, what an attractive job!</p>
