    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Summary</h1><h2 id="abstract"><a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract">🌊</a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper contains some improvements on an algorithmic melody composer called “T-music”. “T-music” is an algorithm which can compose a melody for users’ input lyrics by mining the relationship between the melodies and lyrics. These relationships are  known as frequent patterns (FPS) . The ameliorations are two ways to enhance the methods of mining frequent patterns form instrumental compositions and an optimal way of using FPS mined from songs in one language to compose a melody for the input things  in another language.</p><h2 id="propse"><a class="header-anchor" href="#propse">🌊</a>Propse</h2><p>The propose is to get an algorithm which take lyrics as input and a good melody as outcome in order to help those people who have little music background to compose songs. In view of the fact that there is already a pretty well method, T-music, the authors’  tasks are making some improvements on the basis of the original algorithm.</p><h2 id="deficiencies-of-original-algorithm"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deficiencies-of-original-algorithm">🌊</a>Deficiencies of original algorithm</h2><p>At the first place, I need to borrow a figure from the paper as follows to express my understanding of the original T-music method.</p><p><img src="http://www.meng.uno/images/t-music-arch.png" alt="t-musuc"></p><p>As the picture shows that the system architecture of T-music can be divided as two phases which are “Frequent Pattern Mining” and “Melody Composition”. I will report this method following the flow of the algorithm.</p><ul>  <li>    <p>Mining the FPS from “Song Database” and storing them in the “Frequent Pattern Database”:</p>    <ul>      <li>Obtaining tone sequences from “Song Database” by reading the “Language Dictionary”;</li>      <li>Generating s-sequence from a melody, a pitch sequence and a duration sequence;</li>      <li>Mining the FPS from s-sequence;</li>      <li>Storing the FPS to “Frequent Pattern Database”.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>    <p>Composing a melody for the “Lyrics” based on FPS in the “Frequent Pattern Database”:</p>    <ul>      <li>Obtaining the tone sequence of the lyrics by reading the “Language Dictionary”;</li>      <li>Adding some “Music Parameters” such as some music rules;</li>      <li>Generating “Melody” by the process “Melody Composition” using FPS.</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p>There are some deficiencies of the original T-music algorithm as follows. It can only mine FPS from songs in which lyrics must be present. What’s more, the original one can’t use the FPS mined from a language to compose melody in another language. However,  we can’t always get the ideal songs data which have lyrics embedded easily. What we can get from the Internet are those instrumental compositions in which lyrics are absent. Also, we want to achieve that composing melody in a language with the FPS mined  from another language which can make the algorithm more efficient.</p><h2 id="improvements"><a class="header-anchor" href="#improvements">🌊</a>Improvements</h2><p>What the authors have done provided two ways to mine Frequent Patterns from instrumental compositions and an optimal mapping method for composing a melody using FPS in different language with the input lyrics.</p><p>The first way is “Method emphasizing the original FPS”. I will use the following picture to express my comprehension. Firstly, mining the FPS from songs and storing them in “FP database (General)”. Secondly, mining the frequent pitch trends from “Instrumental  compositions with style database” and storing them in “Frequent pitch trends (Style)” and then using it as a selector to select those FPS storing the matches in “FP database (Style)”.</p><p><img src="http://www.meng.uno/images/t-music-database.png" alt="t-musuc"></p><p>The second way is “Method emphasizing the newly mined frequent pitch trends”. I will also introduce it using the screenshot from the paper. The FPS based on those of the first way was subdivided. The frequent pitch trends are mined as usually. The most  difference is that one pitch trend may match a set of several tone trends.</p><p><img src="http://www.meng.uno/images/t-music-database2.png" alt="t-musuc"></p><p>The optimal mapping method is shown as follows. Firstly, using the same method gets a “FP database” in one language. Then, generating several tone sequences for each tone trend in this “FP database”. There are some lemmas proofed on the paper to decide  the specific number of the mapping.</p><h1>Improvements</h1><p>In this section, I will analysis some excellent algorithms, important thoughts or some key points. Some of them may look small or nothing special, but each has its function.</p><h2 id="using-the-trend-representation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-trend-representation">🌊</a>Using the “Trend” representation</h2><p>If I were doing this job, I could have chosen the simple “absolute” representation, just because this is the most intuitive frequent pattern we can get from songs. After careful consideration, just as the author explains that same melodies which start  at different pitches may sound similar to us. Then, I understand that it is a big wisdom to use the “trend” representation which uses a FP to extract the general rules of a set of FPS with different pitches, simplifying a large number of calculations  and making the result more obvious.</p><h2 id="using-frequent-pitch-trends-style-as-a-selector"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-frequent-pitch-trends-style-as-a-selector">🌊</a>Using “Frequent pitch trends (Style)” as a selector</h2><p>Though we know that “T-music” uses “the FPS between the tone port and the pitch part” and agree the mining method used on mining the frequent pattern which contains a tone trend and a pitch trend, there must be some correlation between “Tone trend” and  “Pitch trend”. Since the instrumental compositions don’t contain lyrics, we couldn’t mine a whole frequent pattern from them. However, we can also mine part of the frequent pattern from them which is “Pitch trend”. For we have so much instrumental compositions  which means we can get enough “Pitch trend” and we already know the correlation between “Tone trend” and “Pitch trend”, we can estimate the frequency of the original frequent pattern and eliminate part of them which have a zero frequency.</p><h2 id="using-the-subsequences-of-original-frequent-pattern"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-subsequences-of-original-frequent-pattern">🌊</a>Using the subsequences of original frequent pattern</h2><p>According to the Apriori property that all nonempty subsets of frequent item set must also be frequent, the authors artfully break the original FPS into smaller form and then making them combine more FPS which can be selected from the original FP database.  By doing this, we can get more frequent patterns from the identical data which means our mining algorithm is more efficient.</p><h2 id="using-multi-map-as-a-data-structure"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-multi-map-as-a-data-structure">🌊</a>Using multi-map as a data structure</h2><p>This data structure allows the task of retrieving a value by a key quickly and returns more than one frequent pattern with a support. From it, we can get a tuple in top-k tuples with some selection strategies and ensure that a pattern with a very large  support isn’t always selected because it doesn’t mean that it is always the best choice.</p><h2 id="employing-the-divide-and-conquer-idea"><a class="header-anchor" href="#employing-the-divide-and-conquer-idea">🌊</a>Employing the divide and conquer idea</h2><p>Considering to compose a melody of a very long lyric, we may need to divide the original tone trend into several shorter tone trends, apply the same procedure on them and then return the concatenation of the results of the sub-problems. It is a simple  idea of solving such problem, but we can’t resist its correctness and effectiveness.</p><h1>Limitations</h1><p>I just list some areas that I think need improvements or I think it can be added slightly on the basis of the original research.</p><h2 id="applying-word-segmentation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#applying-word-segmentation">🌊</a>Applying word segmentation</h2><p>Though the paper has mentioned the use of word segmentation, there is just a word and no detailed explanation. I think I should express my own idea here. Firstly, the word segmentation here isn’t the same of those applied in the fields of natural language  processing (NLP). As we all known, the latter has so many strict norms to follow, however, in the lyrics, the norms aren’t very same. Why we do this in the input lyrics is because we want to determine the length of durations between every two words,  which is different from the propose in the NLP which just wants to add pause at the same length of time between words and words.</p><h2 id="handling-the-tone-trend-with-a-length-of-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#handling-the-tone-trend-with-a-length-of-1">🌊</a>Handling the tone trend with a length of 1</h2><p>In this paper, the authors just simply set the pitch trend to be the input tone trend where, I think, may need improvement. Firstly, we all know that “the tone trend with a length of 1” couldn’t appear individually. It is usually because we matched the  tone sequences before it or after it. I think if we consider dividing the original sequence into overlapping parts using the similar idea of divide and conquer idea, the question may disappear.</p><h2 id="mining-the-relationship-between-tone-trend-and-pitch-trend"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mining-the-relationship-between-tone-trend-and-pitch-trend">🌊</a>Mining the relationship between “tone trend” and “pitch trend”</h2><p>The authors just determine the relationship based on statistics in whether the original T-music method or the improved edition, store the regulars on a multi-map and when using the frequent pattern, the method just randomly selects a tuple from top-k  tuples from the multi-map. Therefore, no matter which one we choose, it is just the original sequence in the FP-database. If there is a very large database which contains a large number of every frequent pattern, it may have a remarkable effect without  complex computations. However, we can’t ensure it or we just want to improve our algorithm with little support of so many records. Let’s look at the following samples which has the form as same as those in the multi-map and assume that the same tone  trend only has the three tuples.</p><figure class="highlight stylus">  <table>    <tr>      <td class="gutter">        <pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre>      </td>      <td class="code">        <pre><span class="line">&lt;<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">0</span>&gt; —&gt; (&lt;<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">0</span>,-<span class="number">1</span>,-<span class="number">2</span>&gt;, <span class="number">10</span>)</span><br><span class="line">&lt;<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">0</span>&gt; —&gt; (&lt;<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">0</span>,-<span class="number">2</span>,-<span class="number">1</span>&gt;, <span class="number">9</span>) </span><br><span class="line">&lt;<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">0</span>&gt; —&gt; (&lt;<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">0</span>,-<span class="number">2</span>,-<span class="number">1</span>&gt;, <span class="number">5</span>)</span><br></pre>      </td>    </tr>  </table></figure><p>As we can see, they have the same tone trend and different pitch trends with different values of a support. If we just use the method described in the paper, we may get the result of the 1st, the 2nd, or the 3rd. However, is it the best one? Maybe not,  I think. I mean maybe <code>&lt;1,1,2,0,-2,-1&gt;</code> is better. I think we need to add some correlation analyses to the pitch trends which have the same tone trends.</p><h1>Expanding Research</h1><p>After reading this paper, I have some ideas for further research and some of them are listed as follows.</p><h2 id="adding-location-variables"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-location-variables">🌊</a>Adding location variables</h2><p>I mean, as we all known, a same lyric may have different melodies when it is at the beginning or at the end of a song. Of course, if we just want to use a simple sentence as its input, this consideration is rather superfluous. However, if the input lyric  is long enough, it is very important then.</p><h2 id="generating-a-melody-with-a-longer-note"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-a-melody-with-a-longer-note">🌊</a>Generating a melody with a longer note</h2><p>This thought is mentioned in the end of the paper as well. We may have noticed that the normal notes will be longer than the syllables of lyrics, at least at the end of each sentence. We may need to modify the match method to add the frequent pattern  which contains group of pitch trends sequences and its corresponding longer tone trends sequences.</p><h2 id="applying-syntactic-analysis"><a class="header-anchor" href="#applying-syntactic-analysis">🌊</a>Applying syntactic analysis</h2><p>The following is my exploratory opinion of the original T-music. If I have many songs with lyrics, I will mine the frequent patterns of syntactic analysis and add them to the “s-sequence” mentioned in this paper. Thus I will reform the original multi-map  as follows.</p><figure class="highlight stylus">  <table>    <tr>      <td class="gutter">        <pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre>      </td>      <td class="code">        <pre><span class="line">(&lt;pitch trend pattern&gt;, &lt;syntax pattern&gt;) —&gt; (&lt;tone trend pattern&gt;, support)</span><br></pre>      </td>    </tr>  </table></figure><p>When we match the input lyrics, we need to not only match the “pitch trend pattern” from the FP-database but also contrast the “syntax pattern” and then make the best decision.</p><h2 id="expanding-to-speech-recognization"><a class="header-anchor" href="#expanding-to-speech-recognization">🌊</a>Expanding to speech recognization</h2><p>I have a simple idea of speech recognization using the same method mentioned in this paper. If I could collect enough voice information spoken by the same person, I would mine the frequent patterns of his intonation habit from the voice data and then  using them to judge whether another voice is his or not.</p><h2 id="expanding-to-password-security"><a class="header-anchor" href="#expanding-to-password-security">🌊</a>Expanding to password security</h2><p>In order to prevent the password being stolen, all websites are making efforts on password diversity. I think the method of mining frequent pattern can be applied to protect users’ password as well. For the same string of ciphers, different people may  type it out in different speeds with different intermission on every two letters. I, for example, usually use the combination of my name and birthday as a password and when I type it out there is a longer break between the last letter of my name and  the first number of my birthday. If we use the same way to mine the frequent patterns form enough times records of someone, we may use the frequent patterns to judge whether it is the right person or not who is typing the password.</p><h2 id="generating-good-problems"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-good-problems">🌊</a>Generating “good problems”</h2><p>I often encounter some tricky programming problems and as we all known, “StackOverflow” is the biggest website which can offer you relevant solutions when you ask a question on it. However, we all want to get the best answer as soon as possible so we  may need to put forward “good questions”. I think the thought of this paper can be applied to this question. We can first collect enough “good questions” from the website and then mine the syntactic frequent patterns of each question by categories.  Finally, we can generate such “good questions” by adding the knowledge of sentence construction and providing some keywords needed.</p><h1>Related Research</h1><p>This paper is about mining frequent patterns which is a subfield of data mining. I will express my understanding mixing information retrieved from the Internet in this field.</p><p>With the rise of big data, so many research topics about data is more and more frequent such as forecasting passenger flow and passenger flow directions during the Spring Festival and predicting the composition of Chinese college entrance examination  this year. Data mining means the process of extracting valuable information and patterns from large amounts of data and these new discovery rules, patterns, information and concepts have potential value. It usually contains the association rules, classification,  estimation, clustering and so on.</p><p>As for association analysis, its propose is to discover interesting links hidden in large data sets and the patterns discovered are usually represented in association rules or frequent item sets just as this paper shown. There are several efficient and  scalable frequent item set mining methods such as Apriori algorithm and FP-growth which needs to construct FP-tree.</p><p>As for classification and prediction, I think it is a more stirring area. Think of this, a marketing manager needs data analysis to help guess whether or not a customer with a given profile will buy a new computer and then the marketing manager would  like to predict how much a given customer will spend during a sale, what an attractive job!</p><p>本文链接: <a href="http://meng.uno/posts/2251dcee/">http://meng.uno/posts/2251dcee/</a> 欢迎转载！</p>]]></content>

All of these must run in the user level. This specification consists  of two parts: a definition of abstract kernel state, and a definition of trap handlers (e.g., system calls) in terms of abstract state transitions. They use fully automated technique to find bugs and this method is full functional verification if program  is free of loops and state is finite.</p><p>The “hv6/hv6/spec/kernel/spec/specs.py” file contains the system calls which use this kind of specification. From the picture, we can see that they use Z3 to prove the correction of the “old” procedure and if it can transfer to a new state or it is runnable,  it will return the new procedure so that it can be proved true.</p><h2 id="declarative-specification"><a class="header-anchor" href="#declarative-specification">🌊</a>Declarative Specification</h2><p>The authors also provide a declarative specification of the high level properties that the state-machine specification should satisfy. The verifier will check that these high level properties are indeed satisfied, helping increase the programmer’s confidence  in the correctness of the state-machine specification. To improve confidence in its correctness, there is a higher-level declarative specification to better capture programmer intuition about kernel behavior, in the form of a conjunction of crosscutting  properties that hold across all trap handlers.</p><p>本文链接: <a href="http://meng.uno/posts/55c9299d/">http://meng.uno/posts/55c9299d/</a> 欢迎转载！</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>VR/AR介绍</h1><p>虚拟现实技术（VR）是一种可以创建和体验虚拟世界的计算机仿真系统，它利用计算机生成一种模拟环境，是一种多源信息融合的、交互式的三维动态视景和实体行为的系统仿真使用户沉浸到该环境中。</p><p>VR是仿真技术的一个重要方向，是仿真技术与计算机图形学人机接口技术多媒体技术传感技术网络技术等多种技术的集合，是一门富有挑战性的交叉技术前沿学科和研究领域。VR主要包括模拟环境、感知、自然技能和传感设备等方面。模拟环境是由计算机生成的、实时动态的三维立体逼真图像。感知是指理想的VR应该具有一切人所具有的感知。除计算机图形技术所生成的视觉感知外，还有听觉、触觉、力觉、运动等感知，甚至还包括嗅觉和味觉等，也称为多感知。自然技能是指人的头部转动，眼睛、手势、或其他人体行为动作，由计算机来处理与参与者的动作相适应的数据，并对用户的输入作出实时响应，并分别反馈到用户的五官。传感设备是指三维交互设备。</p><p>而增强现实技术（AR）是一种实时地计算摄影机影像的位置及角度并加上相应图像、视频、3D模型的技术，这种技术的目标是在屏幕上把虚拟世界套在现实世界并进行互动。AR最早是于1990年提出的，之后随着电子产品运算能力的提升，其应用也是用途愈广。尤其是近两年来AR技术可谓是备受关注！现在的市场中由于可穿戴设备的出现，以及手机性能的进一步提升，AR技术也是持续升温。</p><p>AR是一种将真实世界信息和虚拟世界信息“无缝”集成的新技术，是把原本在现实世界的一定时间空间范围内很难体验到的实体信息（视觉信息,声音,味道,触觉等），通过电脑等科学技术，模拟仿真后再叠加，将虚拟的信息应用到真实世界，被人类感官所感知，从而达到超越现实的感官体验。真实的环境和虚拟的物体实时地叠加到了同一个画面或空间同时存在。不仅展现了真实世界的信息,而且将虚拟的信息同时显示出来，两种信息相互补充、叠加。在视觉化的AR实现中，用户利用头盔显示器，把真实世界与电脑图形多重合成在一起，便可以看到真实的世界围绕着它。</p><p>在接下来的叙述中，我将在第二部分分析VR/AR对于医生角度的应用，第三部分分析在病人角度的应用，第四部分是在医疗教育方面的应用，其他相关的研究我将在第五部分陈述，现阶段研究的不足将在第六部分分析，最后两部分是一点我的个人感想和本文结论。</p><h1>对于医生的应用</h1><h2 id="模拟手术"><a class="header-anchor" href="#模拟手术">🌊</a>模拟手术</h2><p>虚拟手术作为一个虚拟现实领域的重要研究方向，正成为科学家们的关注焦点。它是集现代医学、计算机图形学、计算机视觉、生物力学、材料学、机器人等诸多学科为一体的新型交叉研究领域。医生可以通过虚拟现实技术来模拟、指导医学手术所涉及的各种过程，包括手术计划制定、手术排练演习、手术教学、手术技能训练、术中引导手术、术后康复等。</p><p>80%的手术失误是人为因素引起的，因此手术训练极其重要。以前医生手术训练都只能在病人身上做，所以经常说有名的医生都是踏过多少人的血液才走过来的，这样付出的代价实在太大。在VR/AR技术飞速发展并广泛应用的今天，模拟手术在医生训练过程中非常重要的应用就是，医生可以在不接触实际病人的前提下模拟各种手术场景，模拟的场景可能比真实遇到的情况还要多，这样模拟训练的效果实际上就超过了真实的练刀。一方面，模拟训练可以在任何地方、任何时间反复模拟，深化印象，这个优点在实际病人身上是不可能也不允许做的，因为病人的资源是有限的。模拟手术就是把每个可能的手术场景都呈现在你的面前，每个人得到的机会都是无穷次的，医生可以反复看、反复练，并且对病人没有伤害。如果从这点来讲，一个经过模拟训练的医生再给病人做手术时，他的学习周期就会很短很短，这个实际上是对病人利益的极大保护。当前模拟手术在中国也已经有了，像强生公司、科汇公司的外科培训中心已经有腹腔镜的模拟，也有介入手术的模拟，当然还有达芬奇手术的模拟，但这种模拟还不是真实场景的，也就是说未来在VR技术里面，可以完全进入到手术室，然后在真实的场景里面进行模拟手术，那就更加接近于现实。</p><p>大家应该知道在体育运动里，比如足球、体操，都有慢动作回放，有动作捕捉去分析运动员动作是否做到位了，失误的原因是什么。这个技术同样可以用到外科手术里。通过运动捕捉或者手势识别和VR技术，在外科大夫进行学习或尝试以后，可以复原手术，看到手术的过程，如果有失误，原因是什么。这种回放能极大的帮助医生改进他们的技术。</p><h2 id="远程干预-指导"><a class="header-anchor" href="#远程干预-指导">🌊</a>远程干预/指导</h2><p>世界上首例实验性远程手术已经在1999年成功地进行。虚拟手术与远程干预将能够使在手术室中的外科医生能实时地获得远程专家的交互式会诊。交互工具可以使顾问医生把靶点投影于患者身上来帮助指导主刀外科医生的操作，甚或通过遥控帮助操纵仪器。这能使专家们技能的发挥不受空间距离的限制。如果VR技术在这一方面继续发展的话，可能会出现以后医生不用到医院上班，无论在任何地方都可以实施手术。缓解了当今医院基础设施不足的现状。同时，有些相同的手术，某专家可以通过VR技术远程指导，这样就打破了一个时间段只能进行一项手术的限制，大大提高医疗的效率。</p><h2 id="精确操作"><a class="header-anchor" href="#精确操作">🌊</a>精确操作</h2><p>如上文已经提到的达芬奇机器人，还有很多像这种医生能够远程控制其操作的手术设备，通过使用这些设备，能够在实际的手术中，避免因为医生长时间工作造成的身体情况变化而带来的手术质量参差不起的问题（例如某医生一天手术过多，太过劳累，这样后来的手术必然会质量下降）。如果使用了VR技术，远程控制诸如达芬奇机器人一样的手术设备，不管医生自己身体状况如何，只要控制到位，那些手术设备是不会因为工作时间长就产生不适的，这样也能保证手术质量优秀。同时，一个医生只有两只手，所以有些手术需要助手，而使用那些设备之后，一个医生可以控制很多只手，这样就能够协调统一，对手术质量有百利而无一害。</p><h2 id="协助执行日常任务"><a class="header-anchor" href="#协助执行日常任务">🌊</a>协助执行日常任务</h2><p>医生需要经常查看病人的病情，而在现在的医疗设施情况下，对于一个医生，可能得通过“查房”一间一间地去病房里与病人交流，而且交流记录难免会记忆不清或者甚至搞混了。有了VR技术虚拟医生协助真实医生实现这些复杂的工作，效率必然会大大提高。医生甚至都不用出办公室，只需要观察相应的VR反馈就可以基本实现之前的“查房”任务。这样一来就可以大大减轻医生的负担，必然会对医生的日常工作效率产生积极的影响。这些虚拟医生与病人交流的数据可以保存用来对之后的反馈对比，当然可以用其他机器学习的方法来进行一些预测之类的计算。并且基于大数据，可能这些虚拟医生对单个病人情况的分析会比真实的医生更专业，因为医生也不是能对每个症状都了如指掌的。</p><p>有些病人（例如老人和小孩等）可能在认识自己病情上有欠缺，例如忘记吃药，每次吃多少药等，在传统的方案中，要么有专人提醒，要么在显眼的地方做上标记提醒，总之效率不高或者费时费人力。当我们在某种小的设备上加上VR/AR提醒，以一个三维立体的形象的形式来提醒病人，既省时又省人力，效率相对还比较高。</p><h2 id="获得医药信息"><a class="header-anchor" href="#获得医药信息">🌊</a>获得医药信息</h2><p>医生可能不能记住每种药物的作用，以及每种药物的使用方式，假如能通过VR技术将每种药的使用信息都记录下来，通过相关的设备，让医生在给病人开药的时候头脑里能对这种药的所有情况都回顾一遍，同时还可以与几种相似的药做对比，找出最好的组合，避免偶尔的误用药。</p><h2 id="获取用户机体信息"><a class="header-anchor" href="#获取用户机体信息">🌊</a>获取用户机体信息</h2><p>在现在正常的医学治疗步骤中，医生想要检查病人某部位的病变情况，只能使用诸如CT、CTA等基于切片的二维人体部位图像，这种图像相对来讲专业要求度较高，对人体伤害较大，同时准确性也不能得到保障。将VR应用于此种工作，我们可以得到人体某部位的三维立体真实大小的模型，这样一来医生的判断会更加准确而且这种图识别起来相对不需要那么复杂的专业知识。</p><h2 id="血管照明-辅助手术"><a class="header-anchor" href="#血管照明-辅助手术">🌊</a>血管照明（辅助手术）</h2><p>这算是一种比较专业地说法，和辅助手术概念比较类似，简而言之就是通过PC应用软件帮助医务人员在手术中能够查看隐藏的血管。此前，心脏病专家借助谷歌眼镜疏通了一位49岁男患者阻塞的右冠状动脉。冠状动脉成像（CTA）和三维数据呈现在智能眼镜的显示器上，根据这些实时放大图像，医生可以方便地将血液导流到动脉。不同于传统手术，AR的介入就像一个”AR放大镜”，直接放大手术创口，患者的彩超、MRI、CT图像等将直接映在手术部位，让医生能够看到肉眼难以分辨的细微情况，获得“透视”功能，大大提高手术操作的效率和舒适度。</p><h2 id="损伤评估"><a class="header-anchor" href="#损伤评估">🌊</a>损伤评估</h2><p>在传统的医疗实践中，如果病人就诊，医生为了确定病人病情只能通过明显的外表特征或者患者的口头表述来确定，而这样的手法往往会带来误判或者病情程度判断不清等问题，特别是那种很难表述清楚的内科疾病。运用虚拟现实技术，我们可以针对不同的疾病设定不同的诊断场景，让用户在特定场景中将应该表现出来的病症全部表现出来，这样一来有利于增大诊断的准确性。</p><h1>对于病人的应用</h1><h2 id="智能康复系统"><a class="header-anchor" href="#智能康复系统">🌊</a>智能康复系统</h2><p>基于Kinnect等运动捕捉设备所设计出的很多结合VR/AR技术的智能康复系统，这些系统能够很好的帮助病人进行相应的康复训练。在之前我所看到的一个例子中， 病人只需要带上相应的可穿戴传感器就可以将自己的动作传到相应的计算机进而在计算机显示屏上显示用户的动作以及在显示屏中出现的影像之间的交互。在我所看到的实例中，他们只是能做到在场景中增加一些物体（例如长方体等），让病人在虚拟的环境中模拟各种体力锻炼。这样一来，我们就不需要实际花费很多的金钱来布置训练场景，而且VR所形成的场景还可以很轻易得更换，不用为维护实际的场景而花费很多精力。</p><p>调查显示，以色列的研究人员开发出一套“电脑辅助康复环境系统”，通过模拟划船、打球、慢跑等各种情景，来帮助残障人士改善平衡能力，恢复身体的运动机能。足部神经受损的博罗夫斯基就在接受“电脑辅助康复环境系统”的治疗。现在系统模拟的是“海上冲浪”，大屏幕上显示的是冲浪的场景，博罗夫斯基脚下的踏板会根据设置好的程序相应的摇动，他必须通过调节身体的姿势来保持平衡。同时，连接在他身上的传感器还能把各种身体体征数据传回电脑，以便医生调整训练强度和难度。丰富的影像和新颖的训练方式，让患者像在做游戏一样，更能提高患者本身的主动性和积极性，加强训练效果，缩短住院时间，加快康复过程。无论从时间、人力还是金钱上讲，VR/AR技术的使用必然会在康复系统上带来一场新的革命。</p><h2 id="帮助治疗某些疾病"><a class="header-anchor" href="#帮助治疗某些疾病">🌊</a>帮助治疗某些疾病</h2><p>有些疾病（例如某种危险情况恐惧症），需要病人在再临其境时才可能克服，但如果让患者在现实中的危险环境再次体验，可能会有安全性问题，而且相同的场景很难真实地完美还原。如果使用VR技术，就可以在基本不耗费后期资源的情况下反复体验相同的场景，在现实中，用户也不会有任何的伤害，而且可调节范围比较广，毕竟是电脑虚拟程序，恐怖程度、危险指数等都可以随心所欲地变化，与现实相比真的是有巨大的优势。</p><p>截肢者中最常见的烦恼就是幻肢痛——患者感到被切断的肢体仍在，且在该处发生疼痛。疼痛多在断肢的远端出现，疼痛性质有多种，如电击、切割、撕裂或烧伤等。对幻肢痛的发生原理，目前尚无统一意见，西医亦乏有效疗法。很有可能大脑对肢体仍然存有意识，即使它已经不存在了。尽管这样的问题发生存在一定的频率，但至今没有一种有效地方法适用于所有的截肢者。在使用VR技术治疗过程中研究人员使用头戴式耳机和一个传感器将患者带入虚拟的世界，患者可以感受到自己的肢体还在，并可以控制虚拟肢体从事某项工作或游戏。这样就能很好的解决这一疾病，有研究表明对这种疾病VR治疗作用十分显著。</p><p>VR对创伤后应激障碍也同样有很好的治疗作用。在对从伊拉克和阿富汗返回患有创伤后应激障碍的士兵所进行的VR治疗过程中，VR设备会将会把士兵带回中东的一个小镇，让他们再次“经历”战争和死亡，使其在适当的压力下逐渐学会处理，控制自己的情绪。虽然很多人对于这种治疗方式存在争议，支持者说使用虚拟现实技术与其他的治疗方式相结合会达到非常很理想的治疗效果。</p><p>VR可以帮助治疗的心理障碍并不仅仅局限于创伤后应激障碍。还有些心理问题（例如自闭症、害羞等），是一个杀人于无形的凶手，目前呈现向低龄化蔓延的趋势。虚拟现实可能也会成为这个问题的解决方案之一。如果有人能既为患者保守秘密有能很好的与用户交流，对治疗这些疾病肯定是有很大的好处的，但是现实中不可能存在这样的一个完美的“倾听者”，即使有，价钱也是不菲的。如果VR/AR能够起到这样的作用那必然会是又一大医学进展。</p><p>很多心理治疗师和精神专家常用的方式是通过在治疗过程中去引导患者回忆或者想象场景，以此来达到治疗的目的。VR的好处在于它能够让这种环境场景变得可视化和标准化。因此在心理治疗领域，比如说创伤应急、障碍症、恐惧症、自闭症、恐高症、幽闭症、公开演讲恐惧症、密集恐惧症等都可以通过VR技术的环境再现以达到治疗的目的。再比如说，焦虑症、注意力缺陷以及精神分裂症也可以通过VR来虚拟特定的人或是特效来改善相关的一些症状。</p><h2 id="虚拟问诊"><a class="header-anchor" href="#虚拟问诊">🌊</a>虚拟问诊</h2><p>在国内外，好的医生都是十分欠缺的，然而相同的疾病缺屡见不鲜，可以说很多小病完全可以在还是在早期的时候就通过及时就诊可以避免出现的，在之前的这么多年，很多搜索引擎也都在做相关的疾病问答系统，可悲的是大多受金钱诱惑，为金钱奴役，不干正事反而虚假宣传。VR技术的出现，必然在医疗问答方面带来很大的革新，患者可以通过VR设备与虚拟的医生直接进行交谈，不仅避免了文字表述不清的问题，而且也避免受网页上那么多的虚假广告的诱惑，更是给人一种如见真实医生的舒适的感觉，而且VR医生会比现实中医生更有耐心，更专职为你一人服务。</p><h2 id="缓解疼痛"><a class="header-anchor" href="#缓解疼痛">🌊</a>缓解疼痛</h2><p>读到这样一个故事，“2017年年初，美国的一位脂肪瘤患者开刀时，因为平时血压过高，医生只为她注射了少量镇静剂。医生为她戴上了VR设备，在手术过程中患者一直在玩一个埃及探险的游戏。手术过程中，监测仪器显示患者的一切生命体征参数，都非常平稳。在整个手术过程中，患者的血压不仅没有提升，反而下降了。手术完成后，患者表示她几乎没有感到疼痛。”我觉得有了这个实例，我不需要过多的解释，已经能够很好的说明VR在缓解病人疼痛上的作用了吧。无独有偶，接受重度烧伤治疗是一段痛苦的经历。伤口清理和绷带变化都会引发疼痛，即便使用吗啡等麻醉药物，仍有86%的病人会感到或多或少的疼痛，并且大量使用还会对身体造成一定伤害。1996年，华盛顿大学人机界面技术实验室（HITLab）研究人员发现孩子们在玩游戏时是越来越全神贯注后，想出了为治疗烧伤提供VR游戏，假设沉浸在游戏中会为病人带来积极疗效，他们会更专注于游戏，而减轻对疼痛的注意力。据调查，社会行为医学2011年发布的调查展示了浸入式游戏作为止痛剂的强大作用。并且现在这项技术已经被美国军方使用，帮助受伤的士兵接受治疗。</p><p>当然在平时的生活中，VR也是能够起到很好的。当我们沉浸在一个虚拟的美好的游戏环境中时，我们可以忘记暂时的伤痛，这是一个常识，也是VR能在这一方面得到巨大应用的一个原因。</p><h2 id="戒瘾"><a class="header-anchor" href="#戒瘾">🌊</a>戒瘾</h2><p>当今社会的另一大“疾病”，不是身体上的，更大多数是心理上的，例如网瘾、烟瘾甚至毒瘾。在以前的戒瘾所，采取的唯一方式就是物理上的隔离，在VR技术快速发展的今天，我们完全可以通过VR将患者的精力集中到正确的角度上，不仅可以将效果提高，而且省时省力。查阅资料发现，我国相关法律已经开始涉足使用VR进行戒毒活动了。</p><p>当然，其实在这里VR可能成为一把双刃剑，可能能将用户的注意力从其他那些及其不正常的生活习惯中解救出来，但是可能又会让用户陷入“VR瘾”中，现在我们还无法证明这个“VR瘾”和其他的“网瘾”、“烟瘾”等孰轻孰重，所以此法需要慎重使用。</p><h2 id="vr-ar与视觉结合"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vr-ar与视觉结合">🌊</a>VR/AR与视觉结合</h2><p>VR本身就是可以直接作用于人的视觉，视觉治疗方案与VR技术很容易匹配。现在升学、工作压力，导致大部分人都有眼部疾病或视觉障碍。VR在治疗眼部的疾病，比如儿童的斜视、近视以及立体视力的缺陷上有很好的效果。虽然在不久之前就有对近视等疾病的物理治疗方案，但是大多费时费力，而且没有听说有什么可观的进展。但是VR/AR的到来就完全不同了，大大提高了效率而且效果明显提高。同时可以制作一种VR设备用来缓解疲劳的眼球，当我们工作或者学习很长时间之后，可以用它来对眼球“做做操”。虽然我们都明白久看之后需要远眺一会，或者看看绿色的动西，但是迫于现实，我们可能很难做到（例如哈尔滨的冬天没有绿树。），但是这一切都可以用VR设备来实现。</p><h2 id="缓解术前压力"><a class="header-anchor" href="#缓解术前压力">🌊</a>缓解术前压力</h2><p>接受手术的患者到了陌生环境，难免会有应激反应。他们可能觉得在手术室外等候，麻药还没有生效的时候，他们有强烈的紧张感和恐惧感，甚至有了濒临死亡的体验。现在想一想，这种体验对每个人来说都是非常不好的。虽然术前医生和患者有充足时间做沟通，但是单纯靠用嘴讲、用图、甚至手画示意图，都是一件非常累的事情，因为手术的复杂性和专业性，包括一些专有名词，对患者来说真的是选择性记忆，他们有可能听了上半句，就忘了下半句，甚至把最主要的东西漏掉，支离破碎地理会医生的意思，即使再出色的现场描述也比不过真实环境的真实还原。如果运用VR技术，在手术开始前给患者放一段容易让他放松的内容，让他在进手术室之前，大致了解手术室和手术过程是什么样子的，就能消除他对未知环境的恐惧。我相信这对患者来说是人文的关怀，这在提高医学服务水平里面可以得到有效的应用。</p><h2 id="隐私保护"><a class="header-anchor" href="#隐私保护">🌊</a>隐私保护</h2><p>现在我国的搜索引擎在医疗上很不受人看好的一个主要原因就是其泄露用户隐私的现象太严重，所以很少有人真正愿意相信搜出来的东西。加入VR/AR元素进入我们的生活，我们可以与虚拟形象进行完全不用担心泄露隐私的情况下的交流。</p><h1>医疗教育的应用</h1><h2 id="手术教学"><a class="header-anchor" href="#手术教学">🌊</a>手术教学</h2><p>伴随互联网的继续发展，如果医学手术教育能够通过VR/AR技术实现，至少在解剖学课程上可以实现意想不到的效果。在相关的设计中，例如心脏的VR模型可以做的特别逼真，让学生可以把心脏托在手里面，随时都可以转圈、打开肌肉看，血流都可以看，这就可以大大缩短医学生的学习周期（而且可以打破时间、地点的限制来学习）。尤其对于外科医生来讲，外科医生很重要的工作就是解剖。局部解剖以前医学生只能通过书本来学习，看到的都是平面的东西，脑子里很少有立体的概念，无法产生互动，进而需要很长的时间来消化知识，甚至很多时候大多数医学生并不能形成很好的立体的模型在脑子中，所以这就是很多庸医出现的根源。VR/AR技术的出现使得医学生在真正操刀做手术之前，就能获得局部解剖的经验，能够有效提高手术的安全性和成功率。而如果医学生通过VR/AR技术实现解剖模拟，学习速度会大大加快，同时降低学习的成本。当然AR在医学教育的应用并不仅仅是在解剖学上面，在生理生化方面都是可以通过VR技术模拟场景的。如果我们可以获得很形象的信息的话，对医生的知识拓展和学习速度都会急剧加快。</p><p>据早在1993年的统计里，全球市场上出现的805个虚拟现实应用系统中就有49个应用于医学，主要应用在虚拟人体、医学图像学、药物分子研究等方面。大家都知道，在传统的医学教育中，如人体标本解剖和各种手术实训，大都受到标本、场地等限制，实训费用高昂。而且医学生不能通过反复在病人身上进行操作来提高临床实践能力、临床实践具有较大风险。而VR的直观和体验特性却可以很好地解决以上问题。目前在医学教育上应用较多的有虚拟人体解剖学、手术训练教学、虚拟实验室、虚拟医院等。类别也从内容、软件到硬件，甚至还有从事交叉研发的，比如，Oculus涉足了内容、硬件和软件等方面，微软HoloLens则是软硬件结合等。</p><p>利用VR技术来做外科手术培训另一个重要的特点是，大大节约了成本。在外科领域，医疗知识每隔6~8年就要翻一番，所以外科大夫在专业教育上尤其是在继续教育上需要不断追求对新技术的学习，这种新技术的学习成本是高昂的，方法是复杂的。而VR技术可以在某种程度上帮助大家学习或者熟悉这种新技术。</p><h2 id="教学用具改革"><a class="header-anchor" href="#教学用具改革">🌊</a>教学用具改革</h2><p>传统解剖学挂图和大部分多媒体课件上应用的教学图片都是二维模式，缺少直观的、立体的体验，造成了解剖学习的困难。模型、标本虽具有立体结构，但形式单一、僵硬，不能满足多角度、多层次的教学和实训需求。而虚拟人体解剖图，可在显示人体组织器官解剖结构的同时，显示其断面解剖结构，并可以任意旋转，提供器官或结构在人体空间中的准确定位、三维测量数据和立体图像。此前，美国加州健康科学西部大学（波莫纳）开设了一个虚拟现实学习中心，该中心拥有四种VR技术、zSpace显示屏、Anatomage虚拟解剖台、Oculus Rift和iPad上的斯坦福大学解剖模型，旨在帮助学生利用VR学习牙科、骨科、兽医、物理治疗和护理等知识。</p><h1>相关研究进展</h1><p>尽管业内不少人将2016/2017年称之为“VR发展元年”，若追溯VR发展的历史，早在1932年，Aldous Huxley在其推出的科幻小说《美丽新世界》中即对虚拟现实概念进行了描述。而直到1968年计算机科学家Ivan Sutherland开发了“达摩克利斯之剑”，使得VR设备具备了基本的雏形。随后，VR设备开始应用在一些专精领域，如宇航员的训练活动中。直到1987年，任天堂推出了Famicom3D System眼镜之后，Virtual Boy等设备将VR概念正式带入民用领域。而随着近些年来，视频技术以及移动硬件领域的不断发展，民用VR平台也根据使用者的不同呈现出了分化的状态，包括以游戏平台作为计算平台的专属VR平台、以PC作为计算平台的综合体感VR平台、以及以移动设备作为计算与显示窗口的VR眼镜。</p><p>硬件厂商方面，在对各类VR设备的研发加大投入力度，VR头盔，眼镜，以及附属的传感器设备在过去的一年中纷纷涌现。</p><p>视频平台方面，除了传统视频上传方式外，各大视频平台均开放了“全景视频”的上传接口，用于鼓励视频制作团队为平台增加全景类视频的内容量。但由于目前全景视频的制作与存储成本非常高，能够完成全景视频录制与制作的团队并不多，所以目前多数存留在VR平台端的视频实际为3D的“沉浸式”的视频内容。除此之外，部分平台采取聚合方式，将目前市面上鲜见的VR视频内容加以收集整理，集中呈现在用户面前。而技术方案提供方虽然距离用户较远，却是目前推进整个VR行业发展的最为重要的一方，技术方案将成型的算法，图像引擎等输出给视频平台或硬件厂商，以增强用户在两方的使用体感。</p><h1>存在的问题</h1><p>VR在医疗应用方面，相比用作练习、模拟来讲还是很欠缺的。AR in China 最近期的统计，如今国内从事AR应用开发的企业有200多家，其中80%倾向和已开发游戏类应用，剩余的也多偏向影视、购物等生活类应用。而专注在医健领域的应用，根据公开信息推测目前不超过10家。而在海外，据 CBInsights、CrunchBase、AngelList 网站的综合数据查询，目前有30家左右初创公司正专注在AR医疗应用领域。其中9家初创公司获得融资，总融资额达5.52亿美元，获投率达到了30%。AR在医健领域的应用还处于蓝海探索期。</p><p>纯粹的VR在医疗领域还是有很大欠缺的。在现在的VR辅助手术中，医生只能利用AR技术的一些优势，并不能完全交给VR来做，还需要加上传统方法，一边做手术一边对着电脑屏幕比对着看。</p><p>VR用于治疗方式的缺点是患者的想象和回忆难于把控，所以效果很难评估。</p><p>而且现在的VR在显示和精确度方面还是有很大的提升空间的。特别实在医疗领域，准确度至关重要。</p><p>对于医生而言，还有适应问题，这些新技术对于有经验的外科医生及其他专业医护人员来讲，“适应”是最大的挑战。</p><p>虽然VR技术在医学上应用后能够减少现实中的直接的隐私泄露，但是如果VR数据泄露将导致比现在信息泄露更严重的后果，毕竟VR可以记录整个人的信息而不仅仅是文字信息。</p><p>VR的一个很大的问题就是基础硬件设备的体验问题。如果要让医生或者被治疗者长时间呆在虚拟环境中，很容易产生一些生理不适的症状。</p><p>虽然说VR在医学上的应用很丰富，尤其是在心理治疗方面颇有成效。但是考虑到治疗的针对性和VR内容制作难度等各种问题，这种辅助治疗方法在现阶段很难进行大规模的应用。</p><p>医疗行业需要的是严谨的专业知识和态度，所以对于内容的要求也就相应的提高。如果要开发出一套模拟的人体用来交互培训，需要的是具备医学加上合理内容开发的复合型人才。而且考虑到医学诊断的高精度要求，许多器官或者组织的建模都要非常精细，不能有一丝的马虎，而现在的VR医疗应用更多的还是停留在头戴式VR视频方面。</p><p>其他要面临的困难还有：治疗和评估标准没有相关的评估标准、应用系统的交互性和易用性还不够完美。虚拟现实系统设备及其外设性价比例失衡，设备相对比较昂贵,致使大规模应用的时机还不够成熟。</p><h1>个人感想</h1><p>虽然最近VR/AR技术越来越火，相关研究也相当多，涉及的行业也是相当全面，但是在现在的情况下，绝大多数成就集中在仿真、游戏上，在医疗领域还是存在很多问题，还有很长的路要走。但希望不要又只能火两年而已。</p><p>在医疗工作的各个领域推广VR技术的应用，可以节省大量的时间与资源，从而更快捷、更安全的挽救生命。国际上由于虚拟现实技术的发展而发展起来的医疗电子设备正以每年10%的速度增长。随着计算机、多媒体技术、传感技术、通讯技术的发展以及各国对虚拟现实技术的日益重视，相信这一技术在医学上的应用在将来会取得更大的发展，它的发展前景非常诱人。可以预言，虚拟现实技术在医学中更广泛、更深入的应用将会给传统医疗带来革命性的变化。</p><p>在我们国家，新一轮的医疗体制改革如火如荼，传统的医疗体系已经岌岌可危，惟有引入新的信息技术才能适应时代要求。而且，新的医疗体制改革凸现了“社区医疗”的概念。“社区医疗”在全球医疗信息化中对应其第三个阶段，区域医疗信息网络（GMIS），是继医院管理系统（HMIS）、临床医疗信息系统（CIS）之后的阶段。美国所有医疗机构均实现了信息化管理，而中国尚处在初级阶段。将来中国的趋势必然是走向医疗信息化（e-Health）。为了实现这一战略目标，虚拟现实技术就是最佳的操作工具。因此，虚拟现实技术将在中国的“医改”过程中以及今后医疗事业的发展中扮演更加积极、重要的角色。</p><p>医疗VR是一个给人无限遐想的领域，它不再只存在于科幻小说爱好者的想象中，而是已经走进了临床研究者和现实生活中的医疗工作者的视野。虽然这是一个全新的领域，还不为大众所知，但是医疗VR技术是对患者的生活和医生的工作都可以产生积极影响的应用。我相信VR必将为医学领域带来一场大变革。</p><h1>结论</h1><p>VR/AR作为目前比较新潮的技术，在医学领域作用空前。其在医疗上无论从医生角度、患者角度还是医学教育角度都有着十分巨大的作用。现在相关的科学研究也发展迅速，当然也是存在很多的不足，尤其是我们国家在这方面的研究还很欠缺。在今后的一段时间内，我国的VR开发者还是应该多学习和借鉴国外的先进经验，同时保持在这方面的热情，相信在不久的将来，VR/AR定会在医学领域大大地大放异彩。</p><h1>参考文献</h1><ol>

href="#自己编程实现">🌊</a>自己编程实现</h2><p>在自己编程实现过程中，我也借鉴了很多其他人写的很成熟的方案，最终从数据结构、逻辑结构以及特征计算等方面得到比较合理的一组答案。</p><h3 id="逻辑结构"><a class="header-anchor" href="#逻辑结构">🌊</a>逻辑结构</h3><p>本次实验的程序分为“训练”和“测试”两部分，两部分分别进行的工作如下：</p><h4 id="训练"><a class="header-anchor" href="#训练">🌊</a>训练</h4><p>加载数据<br> 初始化模型  <br> 更新标签  <br> 初始化预测误差  <br> 迭代每个样本（用KT优化）  <br> 得到每个样本的模型  <br> 对步骤5的解释：  <br> 对于svm我们要求解a（数组），如果 a的所有分量满足svm对偶问题的KKT条件，那么这个问题的解就求出来了，我们svm模型学习也就完成了。如果没有满足KKT，那么我们就在 a中找两个分量 ai和 aj，其中 ai 是违反KKT条件最严重的分量，通过计算，使得 ai 和 aj满足KKT条件，直到a的所有分量都满足KKT条件。而且这个计算过程是收敛的，因为每次计算出来的新的两个分量，使得对偶问题中要优化的目标函数值更小。因为每次求解的那两个分量，是要优化问题在这两个分量上的极小值，所以每一次优化，都会使目标函数比上一次的优化结果的值变小。</p><h4 id="测试"><a class="header-anchor" href="#测试">🌊</a>测试</h4><p>加载数据<br> 对每个数据预测  <br> 计算正确率与相关信息逻辑结构  <br> 特征计算  <br> 仿照KKT的优化方法，在本次试验中，我将每张图片作为一个数据。由此得到对每一个测试样本的预测（如果在某个分类的计算时结果为正，则说明该测试样本属于该类别，结果为0则不属于此类别）。</p><h3 id="其他杂项"><a class="header-anchor" href="#其他杂项">🌊</a>其他杂项</h3><p>核函数选择：按照传统，选择的是RBF核函数，函数形式与教材完全相同；<br> 数据来源：来源自网友整理之后的数据（测试数据与训练数据没有均分）；  <br> SMO优化算法：  <br> 取初始值a(0)=0，令K=0；  <br> 选取优化变量a1(k) , a2(k) , 针对优化问题，求得最优解 a1(k+1) , a2(k+1) 更新 a(k) 为 a(k+1) ；<br> 在精度条件范围内是否满足停机条件，即是否有变量违反KKT条件，如果违反了，则令k=k+1，跳转2，否则4；  <br> 求得近似解â =a(k+1)<br> 其中第3步中，是否违反KKT条件，对于a(k)的每个分量按照以下的违反KKT条件的公式进行验算即可。  <br> 变量选取分为两步，第一步是选取违反KKT条件最严重的ai，第二步是根据已经选取的第一个变量，选择优化程度最大的第二个变量。  <br> 违反KKT条件最严重的变量可以按照这样的规则选取，首先看0&lt;ai&lt;C的那些分量中，是否有违反KKT条件的，如果有，则选取yig(xi)最小的那个做为a1。如果没有则遍历所有的样本点，在违反KKT条件的分量中选取yig(xi)最小的做为a1。  <br> 当选择了a1后，如果a1对应的E1为正，选择Ei最小的那个分量最为a2，如果E1为负，选择Ei最大的那个分量最为a2，这是因为anew2依赖于|E1−E2|。 如果选择的a2，不能满足下降的最小步长，那么就遍历所有的支持向量点做为a2进行试用，如果仍然都不能满足下降的最小步长，那么就遍历所有的样本点做为a2试用。如果还算是不能满足下降的最小步长，那么就重新选择a1。</p><h3

PCA ）或者主元分析。是一种掌握事物主要矛盾的统计分析方法，它可以从多元事物中解析出主要影响因素，揭示事物的本质，简化复杂的问题。计算主成分的目的是将高维数据投影到较低维空间。给定 n 个变量的 m 个观察值，形成一个 n * m 的数据矩阵， n 通常比较大。对于一个由多个变量描述的复杂事物，人们难以认识，那么是否可以抓住事物主要方面进行重点分析呢？如果事物的主要方面刚好体现在几个主要变量上，我们只需要将这几个变量分离出来，进行详细分析。但是，在一般情况下，并不能直接找出这样的关键变量。这时我们可以用原有变量的线性组合来表示事物的主要方面，  PCA 就是这样一种分析方法。</p><h3 id="pca作用范围"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pca作用范围">🌊</a>PCA作用范围</h3><p>PCA 主要用于数据降维，对于一系列例子的特征组成的多维向量，多维向量里的某些元素本身没有区分性，比如某个元素在所有的例子中都为1，或者与1差距不大，那么这个元素本身就没有区分性，用它做特征来区分，贡献会非常小。所以我们的目的是找那些变化大的元素，即方差大的那些维，而去除掉那些变化不大的维，从而使特征留下的都是“精品”，而且计算量也变小了。 对于一个K维的特征来说，相当于它的每一维特征与其他维都是正交的（相当于在多维坐标系中，坐标轴都是垂直的），那么我们可以变化这些维的坐标系，从而使这个特征在某些维上方差大，而在某些维上方差很小。</p><h3 id="pca的算法步骤"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pca的算法步骤">🌊</a>PCA的算法步骤</h3><ol>  <li>    <p>设有m条n维数据。</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>将原始数据按列组成n行m列矩阵X</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>将X的每一行（代表一个属性字段）进行零均值化，即减去这一行的均值</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>求出协方差矩阵C=1/mXX’</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>求出协方差矩阵的特征值及对应的特征向量</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>将特征向量按对应特征值大小从上到下按行排列成矩阵，取前k行组成矩阵P</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Y=PX即为降维到k维后的数据</p>  </li></ol><h2 id="实验环境"><a class="header-anchor" href="#实验环境">🌊</a>实验环境</h2><p>Spyder 作为Python开发的集成开发环境；<br> 编程语言：Python 3.5<br> 操作系统：macOS Sierra</p><h2 id="小结"><a class="header-anchor" href="#小结">🌊</a>小结</h2><h3 id="pca的应用分析"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pca的应用分析">🌊</a>PCA的应用分析</h3><p>对于一个训练集，100个对象模板，特征是10维，那么它可以建立一个100*10的矩阵，作为样本。求这个样本的协方差矩阵，得到一个10*10的协方差矩阵，然后求出这个协方差矩阵的特征值和特征向量，应该有10个特征值和特征向量，我们根据特征值的大小，取前四个特征值所对应的特征向量，构成一个10*4的矩阵，这个矩阵就是我们要求的特征矩阵，100*10的样本矩阵乘以这个10*4的特征矩阵，就得到了一个100*4的新的降维之后的样本矩阵，每个特征的维数下降了。当给定一个测试的特征集之后，比如1*10维的特征，乘以上面得到的10*4的特征矩阵，便可以得到一个1*4的特征，用这个特征去分类。所以做PCA实际上是求得这个投影矩阵，用高维的特征乘以这个投影矩阵，便可以将高维特征的维数下降到指定的维数。</p><p>在进行基因表达数据分析时，一个重要问题是确定每个实验数据是否是独立的，如果每次实验数据之间不是独立的，则会影响基因表达数据分析结果的准确性。对于利用基因芯片所检测到的基因表达数据，如果用 PCA 方法进行分析，可以将各个基因作为变量，也可以将实验条件作为变量。当将基因作为变量时，通过分析确定一组“主要基因元素”，它们能够很好地说明基因的特征，解释实验现象；当将实验条件作为变量时，通过分析确定一组“主要实验因素”，它们能够很好地刻画实验条件的特征，解释基因的行为。</p><p>PCA作为基础的数学分析方法，其实际应用十分广泛，比如人口统计学、数量地理学、分子动力学模拟、数学建模、数理分析等学科中均有应用，是一种常用的多变量分析方法。</p><h3

可减少指标选择的工作量；</p><p>用少数指标代替多数指标，利用PCA降维是最常用的算法；<br> 计算方法简单，易于实现。</p><h4 id="缺点："><a class="header-anchor" href="#缺点：">🌊</a>缺点：</h4><p>主成分解释其含义往往具有一定的模糊性，不如原始样本完整；</p><p>贡献率小的主成分往往可能含有对样本差异的重要信息；</p><p>特征值矩阵的正交向量空间是否唯一有待讨论；</p><p>属于无监督学习。</p><h2 id="代码"><a class="header-anchor"

id="算法原理"><a class="header-anchor" href="#算法原理">🌊</a>算法原理</h2><h3 id="gmm算法"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gmm算法">🌊</a>GMM算法</h3><p>高斯模型就是用高斯概率密度函数（正态分布曲线）精确地量化事物，将一个事物分解为若干的基于高斯概率密度函数（正态分布曲线）形成的模型。</p><p>对图像背景建立高斯模型的原理及过程：图像灰度直方图反映的是图像中某个灰度值出现的频次，也可以认为是图像灰度概率密度的估计。如果图像所包含的目标区域和背景区域相比比较大，且背景区域和目标区域在灰度上有一定的差异，那么该图像的灰度直方图呈现双峰-谷形状，其中一个峰对应于目标，另一个峰对应于背景的中心灰度。对于复杂的图像，尤其是医学图像，一般是多峰的。通过将直方图的多峰特性看作是多个高斯分布的叠加，可以解决图像的分割问题。 在智能监控系统中，对于运动目标的检测是中心内容，而在运动目标检测提取中，背景目标对于目标的识别和跟踪至关重要。而建模正是背景目标提取的一个重要环节。</p><p>我们首先要提起背景和前景的概念，前景是指在假设背景为静止的情况下，任何有意义的运动物体即为前景。建模的基本思想是从当前帧中提取前景，其目的是使背景更接近当前视频帧的背景。即利用当前帧和视频序列中的当前背景帧进行加权平均来更新背景,但是由于光照突变以及其他外界环境的影响，一般的建模后的背景并非十分干净清晰，而高斯混合模型是是建模最为成功的方法之一。</p><p>混合高斯模型使用K（基本为3到5个）个高斯模型来表征图像中各个像素点的特征,在新一帧图像获得后更新混合高斯模型, 用当前图像中的每个像素点与混合高斯模型匹配,如果成功则判定该点为背景点, 否则为前景点。</p><p>通观整个高斯模型，主要是有方差和均值两个参数决定，对均值和方差的学习，采取不同的学习机制,将直接影响到模型的稳定性、精确性和收敛性 。由于我们是对运动目标的背景提取建模，因此需要对高斯模型中方差和均值两个参数实时更新。为提高模型的学习能力,改进方法对均值和方差的更新采用不同的学习率;为提高在繁忙的场景下,大而慢的运动目标的检测效果,引入权值均值的概念,建立背景图像并实时更新,然后结合权值、权值均值和背景图像对像素点进行前景和背景的分类。</p><p>具体实现过程：</p><ol>  <li>为图像的每个像素点指定一个初始的均值、标准差以及权重。</li>  <li>收集N（一般取200以上，否则很难得到像样的结果）帧图像利用在线EM算法得到每个像 素点的均值、标准差以及权重。</li>  <li>从N+1帧开始检测，检测的方法：<br> 对每个像素点：    <ol>      <li>将所有的高斯核按照 ω / σ 降序排序</li>      <li>选择满足下式的前M个高斯核：M = arg min(ω / σ &gt; T)</li>      <li>如果当前像素点的像素值在中有一个满足：就可以认为其为背景点。</li>    </ol>  </li>  <li>更新背景图像，用EM算法。</li></ol><h3 id="em算法"><a class="header-anchor" href="#em算法">🌊</a>EM算法</h3><p>EM 算法是 Dempster，Laind，Rubin 于 1977 年提出的求参数极大似然估计的一种方法，它可以从非完整数据集中对参数进行 MLE 估计，是一种非常简单实用的学习算法。这种方法可以广泛地应用于处理缺损数据，截尾数据，带有噪声等所谓的不完全数据(incomplete data)。</p><p>最大期望算法经过两个步骤交替进行计算：</p><ul>  <li>第一步是计算期望（E），利用对隐藏变量的现有估计值，计算其最大似然估计值；</li>  <li>第二步是最大化（M），最大化在 E 步上求得的最大似然值来计算参数的值。</li></ul><p>M 步上找到的参数估计值被用于下一个 E 步计算中，这个过程不断交替进行。</p><p>通过交替使用这两个步骤，EM算法逐步改进模型的参数，使参数和训练样本的似然概率逐渐增大，最后终止于一个极大点。直观地理解EM算法，它也可被看作为一个逐次逼近算法：事先并不知道模型的参数，可以随机的选择一套参数或者事先粗略地给定某个初始参数λ0 ，确定出对应于这组参数的最可能的状态，计算每个训练样本的可能结果的概率，在当前的状态下再由样本对参数修正，重新估计参数λ，并在新的参数下重新确定模型的状态，这样，通过多次的迭代，循环直至某个收敛条件满足为止，就可以使得模型的参数逐渐逼近真实参数。</p><p>具体实现步骤：</p><ul>  <li>给出种类数k,初始化每一类高斯分布的均值μk，方差∑k以及每一类的概率πk；</li>  <li>执行EM；</li>  <li>计算似然，如果没有达到预期效果，则返回第2步；</li>  <li>计算每个数据点对于k个高斯分布的似然，选择似然最大的一类作为数据的最终分类。</li></ul><p>其他的混合模型，例如朴素贝叶斯混合模型也是可以使用EM算法推出使用的，这一算法虽然在GMM中作为参数使用，但是其仍然可以单独发挥作用。我觉得EM算法就是相互迭代（毕竟其由E和M两部分组成嘛），求出一个稳定值，而这种相互迭代的方法用的范围挺广的，例如混合模型，K-means等都需要使用。</p><h3 id="与k-means的区别"><a class="header-anchor" href="#与k-means的区别">🌊</a>与K-means的区别</h3><p>在上文我也已经提到了EM算法可以用在K-means等其他需要迭代的方法上的事实，其实，我觉得GMM 和 K-means 很像，只不过后者要简单，而且相对来说实现并不是很高效。不过 GMM 是学习出一些概率密度函数来（所以 GMM 除了用在 clustering 上之外，还经常被用于 density estimation ），简单地说，K-means 的结果是每个数据点被 assign 到其中某一个 cluster 了，而 GMM 则给出这些数据点被 assign 到每个 cluster 的概率，又称作  soft assignment。</p><h2 id="实验环境"><a class="header-anchor"

href="#gmm与k-means的思考">🌊</a>GMM与K-means的思考</h3><p>提到GMM不得不提K-means，总结了网上的资料以及老师上课的课件，我将两者的区别与联系陈述如下：</p><ul>  <li>两者的联系:</li></ul><p>都是迭代执行的算法，且迭代的策略也相同：算法开始执行时先对需要计算的参数赋初值，然后交替执行两个步骤，一个步骤是对数据的估计（k-means是估计每个点所属簇；GMM是计算隐含变量的期望）；第二步是用上一步算出的估计值重新计算参数值，更新目标参数（k-means是计算簇心位置；GMM是计算各个高斯分布的中心位置和协方差矩阵）</p><ul>  <li>两者的区别:</li></ul><p>首先，两者需要计算的参数不同：K-means是簇心位置；GMM是各个高斯分布的参数；其次，两者计算目标参数的方法不同：K-means是计算当前簇中所有元素的位置的均值；GMM是基于概率的算法，是通过计算似然函数的最大值实现分布参数的求解的。</p><h3 id="关于gmm引发的过拟合的思考"><a class="header-anchor" href="#关于gmm引发的过拟合的思考">🌊</a>关于GMM引发的过拟合的思考</h3><p>首先我想提到这样的一个“人辨认其他生物（例如鱼）”的例子。当我们被告知水里游的那个生物是鱼之后，我们会使用“在同样的地方生活的是同一种东西”这类似的假设，归纳出“在水里游的都是鱼”这样一个结论。当然这个过程是完全“本能”的，如果不仔细去想，我们也不会了解自己是怎样“认识鱼”的。另一个值得注意的地方是这样的假设并不总是完全正确的，甚至可以说总是会有这样那样的缺陷的，因为我们有可能会把虾、龟、甚至是潜水员当做鱼。也许你觉得可以通过修改前提假设来解决这个问题，例如，基于“生活在同样的地方并且穿着同样衣服的是同一种东西”这个假设，你得出结论：在水里有并且身上长有鳞片的是鱼。可是这样还是有问题，因为有些没有长鳞片的鱼现在又被你排除在外了。</p><p>机器在识别方面面临着和人一样的问题，在机器学习中，一个学习算法也会有一个前提假设，这里被称作“归纳偏执”。例如线性回归，目的是要找一个函数尽可能好地拟合给定的数据点，它的归纳偏执就是“满足要求的函数必须是线性函数”。一个没有归纳偏执的学习算法从某种意义上来说毫无用处，就像一个完全没有归纳能力的人一样，在第一次看到鱼的时候有人告诉他那是鱼，下次看到另一条鱼了，他并不知道那也是鱼，因为两条鱼总有一些地方不一样的，或者就算是同一条鱼，在河里不同的地方看到，或者只是看到的时间不一样，也会被他认为是不同的，因为他无法归纳，无法提取主要矛盾、忽略次要因素，只好要求所有的条件都完全一样──然而哲学家已经告诉过我们了：世界上不会有任何样东西是完全一样的，所以这个人即使是有无比强悍的记忆力，也绝学不到任何一点知识。</p><p>于是有了上面的铺垫，我们就可以引出论题——“过拟合 ”，就像前面的回归的问题，如果去掉“线性函数”这个归纳偏执，因为对于 N 个点，我们总是可以构造一个 N-1 次多项式函数，让它完美地穿过所有的这 N 个点，或者如果我用任何大于 N-1 次的多项式函数的话，我们甚至可以构造出无穷多个满足条件的函数出来。如果假定特定领域里的问题所给定的数据个数总是有个上限的话，我可以取一个足够大的 N ，从而得到一个（或者无穷多个）“超级函数”，能够拟合这个领域内所有的问题。</p><p>没有归纳偏执或者归纳偏执太宽泛会导致过拟合 ，然而另一个极端──限制过大的归纳偏执也是有问题的：如果数据本身并不是线性的，强行用线性函数去做回归通常并不能得到好结果（例如我在“实验一：多项式拟合曲线”中就做过相应的测试）。难点正在于在这之间寻找一个临界点。不过我们在这里相对于机器来说有一个很大的优势：人通常不会孤立地用某一个独立的系统和模型去处理问题，一个人每天都会从各个来源获取大量的信息，并且通过各种手段进行整合处理，归纳所得的所有知识最终得以统一地存储起来，并能有机地组合起来去解决特定的问题。</p><p>以上就是我关于“过拟合”的一点不全面的思考！</p><p>本文链接:
